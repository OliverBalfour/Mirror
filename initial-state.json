Often times, the structure you plan tends to lead to some sections being a thousand words long while others are tiny. Restructuring your notes is difficult and tedious, and it's hard to judge when you need to do so.\n\nIn Zettelkasten, you can reorganise your notes frictionlessly by just changing a link or splitting one note into two. As each note is small to begin with, it's easy to see when to split them (principle of atomicity), and having more notes does not decrease ease of use."},"20200921-114801":{"id":"20200921-114801","type":1,"created":1600652881728,"edited":1600652906300,"moved":1600652881728,"content":"Emphasises Links Between Ideas","description":"When you write in a notebook, often ideas connect in complex ways which the medium of a notebook cannot easily express. For instance, you may have an idea on page 47 that builds on another on page 22. To benefit from this link you would need to reread your notebook to find it, and then write a page number as a reference, which is quite clunky.\n\nIn a hierarchical note taking program, often times ideas in different sections are linked, which is not easily accounted for.\n\nIn Zettelkasten, the structure naturally arises to suit your needs. You may find yourself writing notes that link to a number of other notes, as portals into a specific topic. You may find you need to link ideas in different domains as well, and this can be accomplished through the one inter-card linking mechanism."},"20200921-115100":{"id":"20200921-115100","type":1,"created":1600653060746,"edited":1602463940510,"moved":1600653060746,"content":"Ideas for Notes","description":"You can use notes to represent anything. Here is a list of uses I have found for them:\n\n* Crazy ideas. This forces you to fully form your idea and allows you to revisit it or link it to other ideas later.\n* Overviews of concepts. Think Wikipedia articles, but far shorter and only describing what is relevant to your needs. If you use a notebook in classes, you can summarise them into notes here to grow your Zettelkasten.\n* Hub notes. These are a common pattern for organising your notes by creating notes which link to a number of notes on a certain topic.\n* Annotated bibliographical entries. Add a citation and some key points, and when you write a note elsewhere you can cite your bibliographical notes.\n* Blog post ideas\n* Networking. Never tried this though.\n* Tutorials.
